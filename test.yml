    Start the Guest VM
    
    To start the Guest VM, you will want to install virt-manager with yum -y install virt-manager. Once this is complete, you can access it from the Applications menu.
    
    You'll need to reset the Guest VM's root password - please set it to p1n3h34d.
    
    
    Download and Configure Apache to serve "index.html" from /var/web and access it from the host machine
    
    You can install Apache using:
    
    yum install httpd
    
    And then editing /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to change the DocumentRoot as required.
    
    
    Create 3 users that belong to the "Instructors" supplemental group. The users are: Derek, Tom, and Kenny. Ensure Tom cannot login to a shell. Set Tom's account to expire in 10 days from the current date.
    
    You can create the users using the useradd command. Shell modifications are done with usermod and you can set an expiration date using the chage command
    
    
    Configure Umask to ensure all files created by any user cannot be accessed by "other" users
    
    The default umask for all users is set in the /etc/profile file.
    
    
    Find all files in /etc (without searching subdirectories) that are older than 720 days and output them to /root/oldfiles.
    
    The find command has numerous flags that can help with this.
    
    -maxdepth 1 will search only /etc and not any subdirectories.
    
    -mtime +720 will match on files that were modified more than 720 days ago.
    
    So the complete command is:
    
    find /etc/ -maxdepth 1 -mtime +720 > /root/oldfiles
    
    
    Find all log messages containing "ACPI" in /var/log/messages and export them to a file called "logs" stored in the root home directory. Then, gzip /var/log and save to /tmp/log_archive.tgz
    
    To find matching lines in a file you should use grep.
    
    grep ACPI /var/log/messages > /root/logs
    
    Then you need to compress /var/log.
    
    tar -czf /tmp/log_archive.tgz /var/log/
    
    
    Modify the GRUB timeout to be only 1 second instead of 5
    
    Edit /etc/default/grub and change the timeout to 1.
    
    Then you must run grub2-mkconfig to rebuild the grub configuration and make the change live.
    
    
    Create a cronjob for derek that runs echo /etc/redhat-release daily at 4:27pm and redirects the output to /home/derek/release
    
    To edit a user's crontab you can run:
    
    crontab -e derek
    
    And then the format of the line for this task would be:
    
    27 16 * * * echo /etc/redhat-release > /home/derek/release
    
    
    Configure time.nist.gov as the only NTP server
    
    The NTP client in RHEL and CentOS is chrony. The configuration file for chrony is /etc/chrony.conf.
    
    Edit that file and remove the default lines that begin with server and write a new one similar to:
    
    server time.nist.gov
    
    
    Create an 800M swap partition on the vdb disk and ensure it is persistent. Use the UUID to enable persistence.

    Create a new logical volume, LV-A, with a size of 30 extents belonging to the volume group, VG-A, with a PE size of 32M. After you create the volume, configure the server to mount it persistently on /mnt.
    
    First we need to create a physical volume. Let's assume your disk is /dev/sdb.
    
    pvcreate /dev/sdb
    
    Then we need to create the Volume Group named VG-A with a 32M Physical Extent size.
    
    vgcreate VG-A /dev/sdb -s 32m
    
    Finally we create the Logical Volume named LV-A with 30 extents.
    
    lvcreate -n LV-A -l 30 VG-A
    
    Now you can format the volume:
    
    mkfs.xfs /dev/VG-A/LV-A
    
    You can then edit /etc/fstab and add the following line:
    
    /dev/mapper/VG-A-LV-A     /mnt    xfs    defaults    0 0
    
    
    On the *host*, not the guest VM, Utilize ldap.linuxacademy.com for SSO and configure autofs to mount users' home directories on login. Ensure you utilize Kerberos
    
    The server is ldap.linuxacademy.com The Kerberos certificate is located at http://ldap.linuxacademy.com/pub/cert.pem
    
    
    Change the hostname of the guest to "rhcsa"
    
    For this task you can use hostnamectl.
    
    hostnamectl set-hostname rhcsa

    
    yum module enable module-name:stream
    yum install module-name
    yum module list
    yum module info --profile httpd
